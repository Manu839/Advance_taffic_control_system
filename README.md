# Advance_taffic_control_system

Introducing the NextGen Traffic Control System, a revolutionary advancement in urban mobility management. This cutting-edge system utilizes advanced sensors and artificial intelligence algorithms to dynamically assess vehicle density in each lane of the road network.

By constantly monitoring traffic flow, the NextGen system accurately calculates the density of vehicles in real-time. Using this data, it intelligently prioritizes lanes based on congestion levels, ensuring smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.

Through precise timing adjustments, the system allocates green signal times to lanes with higher vehicle density, optimizing the overall efficiency of the traffic flow. This proactive approach minimizes delays, enhances safety, and improves the overall driving experience for commuters.

With the NextGen Traffic Control System, cities can achieve unparalleled levels of efficiency in managing traffic congestion, leading to reduced emissions, shorter travel times, and a more sustainable urban environment.

Here the project proposes to implement an artificial density traffic control system using Raspberrypi. The hardware here we are using is IR sensor, Raspberry pi, Jumper wire, Red and Green led, the software used is MATLAB and python is used as a programming language.
